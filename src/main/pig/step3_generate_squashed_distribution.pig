 * to score each of the drug-drug-reaction triples based on how surprising

 *
 * The input to this stage is the set of (actual count, expected count)
 * pairs for each triple that was the output of step 2. For each distinct
 * value of actual count, we want to get a compressed version of the
 * distribution of expected counts that occur with that actual count.
 * The most straightforward way to do this is to compute the quantiles of
 * the expected counts for each of the actual counts, and then compute the
 * mean expected count for each (actual_count, quantile_bucket) combination.
